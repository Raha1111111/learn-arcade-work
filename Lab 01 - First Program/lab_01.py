Compiled: The computer takes the original source code, and uses a compiler to translate it to machine code. The user then run the machine code. The original source code is not needed to run the program. “C” is an example of a language that works this way. So is the 2GL assembly language we just talked about.
Interpreted: The computer looks at the source code and translates/runs it line-by-line. The compile step is not needed, but the user needs both the source code and an interpreter to run the program. Python is an example of an interpreted language.
Runtime Environment: Languages such as Java and C# take source code, and compile the source code to a machine language. But not the language of your actual machine, they compile to a virtual machine. This is a separate program that acts as a layer between the real machine and the compiled code. This allows for better security, portability, and memory management.
